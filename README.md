Introduction:
    Oction is an online marketplace and platform that conducts auctions between sellers and buyers. It provides services for transactions of those merchandise that can be authenticated by our authenticator team, primarily clothing, sneakers and delicate collection.

User-guideline:
    The homepage has a search box, type keywords to search, or type nothing to list all items. In the preloaded datasets, all items have either "Nike" or "UT" keyword. And users may use the filter for category filtration.

   The application has also pre-loaded some data for demostration purposes, including two users ((user, user) and (user2, user2)), one admin (admin, admin) and some iteractions between the users. User1 has made some bids to the item "Nike Kobe 7" in the "SNEARKERS" category. Some of the bids or asks have induced some transactions to happen, while some not since there is no match. The transaction history can be view in the itempage for "Nike Kobe 7". The user will be able to see up to 5 highest bids or lowest asks in the itempage. If the user wants to view the entire list of asks or bids besides the 5, it can be achieved by click the two "view all" buttons.

   In the admin page, there are two tables, one for managing all the transactions actions and the other for managing user infos. The administrator is able to change the status of order, from initially "Order Placed". The admin supposedly should change the status to "Received" and then "Passed" or "Rejected". The admin is also able to change the user password. 

   Most of the basic functionalities of the application have been implemented. So users can use the search box either from the homepage or searchpage to look for items, signup and login to their accounts and view their transaction histories, place bids or asks on items, look at the historical sales data and look at all the current bids and asks. 
    
  Admin can add a merchandise to the site. When admin adds a merchandise, the merchandise needs an photo associated with it.

   More features will be introduced in Phase 2 of the project. 

Note: Make sure to run "npm install" before running "npm start"
