Introduction:
    Oction is an online marketplace and platform that conducts auctions between sellers and buyers. It provides services for transactions of those merchandise that can be authenticated by our authenticator team, primarily clothing, sneakers and delicate collection.

User-guideline:
    The homepage has a search box, type keywords to search, or type nothing to list all items. In the preloaded datasets, all items have either "Nike" or "UT" keyword. And users may use the filter for category filtration.

    The application has also pre-loaded some data for demostration purposes, including two users ((user, user) and (user2, user2)), one admin (admin, admin) and some iteractions between the users. User1 has made some bids to the item "Nike Kobe 7" in the "SNEARKERS" category. Some of the bids or asks have induced some transactions to happen, while some not since there is no match. 

    In the admin page, the administrator is able to change the status of order, from initially "Order Placed". The admin supposedly should change the status to "Received" and then "Passed" or "Rejected". The admin is also able to change the user info, such as username and password. 

    Most of the basic functionalities of the application have been implemented. So users can use the search box to look for items, signup and login to their accounts, place bids or asks, look at the historical sales data or look at all the current bids and asks. 
    
    However, the only basic feature that the application currently is lacking is the ability for admin to add an merchandise to the site. Because every merchandise needs an photo associated with it and our group has not figured out a way of uploading pictures to the database(which is currently missing). 

    More features will be introduced in Phase 2 of the project.
